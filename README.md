# AMAZON-TOP-50-BEST-SELLING-BOOKS

# INTRODUCTION
   Amazon is a e-commerce website were millions of different types of items are sold. Interestingly, Books was the first product sold on amazon by Jeff Bezos before he became the world’s richest person. Here, we will take a look at top 50 best selling books of amazon to derive some useful insights from them.
# BUSINESS PROBLEM
As a data analyst, Amazon marketing team and senior managers want me to run a descriptive analysis to find out some useful insights which can help them in effectively managing Books inventory so that they never run out of stock for most in demand books and I am also expected to find out if price has anything to do with a book being bestseller multiple times.

# ASSUMPTIONS

The information is still current and can be used to derive insights, which Amazon’s business team can further use to make strategic plans.
The company isn’t currently using any of the suggested solutions in the report.

# Work description
I will be analysing the data base Amazon Top 50 Bestselling Books, between 2019 and 2022, using R programming.

At the end I hop to answer the following questions:
* Which Genre is preferred more by customers?
* In non-fiction and fiction genre which author’s book has been bestseller multiple times?
* Which are the most in demand books that have been bestseller multiple times in different years?
* Are there any books from this 50 top selling books which have less than 4 ratings?
* Does price have any impact on the number of times a book has been bestseller?
* How is the ratings of this books by genre?
